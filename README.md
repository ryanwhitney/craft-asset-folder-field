# Asset Folder Field plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

A dropdown field that lets you select from folders in the Assets section of a Craft CMS site.

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-RC1 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require ryanwhitney/asset-folder-field

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for Asset Folder Field.

## Asset Folder Field Overview

Asset Folder Field adds a custom FieldType to Craft CMS called Asset Folder. This lets you choose from any folder found in the Assets section, which then returns a folderId. 

This plugin is pretty basic, but gets the job done. Pull requests are very welcome.

## Templating

The folderId output by the Asset Folder field can then be used to work with assets and asset folders in your templates.

#### Get Folder Name:
```twig
{# Assign the output folderId to a variable #}
{% set selectedFolderId = entry.<YourAssetFolderFieldHandle> %}

{# Find the first image in the folder as an anchor to be able to call the folder name from. #}
{% set firstImageInFolder = craft.assets.folderId(selectedFolderId).one() %}

{# Make sure that isn't null, in case the folder is empty. #}
{% if firstImageInFolder is not null %}
	{{ firstImageInFolder.folder }}
{% endif %} 
 ```
 #### Loop Through Images From Folder:
 ```twig
{% set selectedFolderId = entry.<YourAssetFolderFieldHandle> %}
{% set assets = craft.assets.folderId(selectedFolderId).all() %}
{% for image in assets %}
    <h2>{{ image.title }}</h2>
        <img src="{{ image.url }}" alt="{{ image.title }}" />
{% endfor %}
```
